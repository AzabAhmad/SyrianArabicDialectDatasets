### Syrian Arabic Dialect Datasets
This repository contains datasets in Syrian Arabic Dialect, designed to support research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as topic detection and sentiment analysis.

Currently, two datasets are planned for release:

- Arabic Topic Detection Dataset for Syrian Dialect (ATDSy).
- Sentiment Analysis Corpus of Syrian Dialect Facebook Posts (ASASy). [Available](Sentiment Analysis Corpus/)


Each dataset will be organized in a separate folder with its own documentation.
